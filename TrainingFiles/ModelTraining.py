# This file is a file to trail an AI model to convert 3D Cords into 2D cords
# A mathmatical project could be used but I am not sure how to do that

# Noah Robitshek Summer 2024


# To Do: somehow safe this model to be used later in functions.py 
# change the x train and y train so that they read from a .txt file
