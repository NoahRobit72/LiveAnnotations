Training Demands  
1. Make an optitrack writer that will write x, y, z to a txt file with the epoch time
2. Move over the red scaling proram
3. run both at the same time and made a dataset
4. use the ML porogram to train a model on the data
5. save the model somewhere

Demo
1. adapt opticrack writer that will listen to the multicast and write to influx
2. datapt the pythond file to read from the multicast
3. write a function to use the model from befre and see how it works
